📖 Project Context
Bharat Herald once printed over 1 million copies daily, but by 2024 this had fallen to nearly half.
Key challenges included:

Pandemic-driven acceleration of digital news consumption
Failed digital pilot in 2021 due to poor usability
Declining advertiser confidence
Bureau closures and layoffs
Competitors such as DigiHindi Post, NewsZilla, and InShorts adapted faster with mobile-first strategies, leaving Bharat Herald behind.

🎯 Business Problem
The management wanted to understand:

Why circulation and ad revenues are declining
Which cities and categories still have profitability potential
How to strategically relaunch digital initiatives
🗂️ Approach
The analysis was structured into three levels:

Primary Analysis → Circulation, ad revenue, and digital adoption trends
Strategy & Recommendations → Supporting context and strategy recommendations
Ad-hoc Requests → Specific explorations for sharper decision-making
📊 Key Insights
📰 Circulation
Copies printed dropped from 44.1M in 2019 → 33.1M in 2024 (consistent 5–6% decline per year).
Top circulation cities (Jaipur, Varanasi, Mumbai, Delhi, Kanpur) together make up 60% of volume but are less profitable.
Smaller cities like Lucknow, Patna, Ranchi show higher profitability indices (above 19).
📉 Print Waste
Annual waste fell from 4.5M (2019) → 3.5M (2024), a 22% reduction.
However, Delhi shows no improvement, wasting ~450k copies every year.
💰 Advertising
Real Estate (+33%) and Automobile (+40%) recovered strongly.
FMCG (–29%) and Government Ads (–17%) declined steadily.
Patna, Jaipur, and Lucknow together contribute ~35% of total ad revenue.
Circulation ≠ Revenue → Patna and Lucknow outperform despite smaller circulation bases.
📱 Digital Readiness vs Engagement
High readiness, low engagement cities: Kanpur, Bhopal, Patna, Ranchi.
These are priority markets for digital re-launch.
⚖️ Revenue Efficiency
Lucknow (₹23/copy), Patna (₹21.2/copy), Ranchi (₹19/copy) lead in monetization efficiency.
Larger cities like Delhi and Varanasi underperform despite scale.
🚀 Recommendations
Phased Digital Transition

Phase 1 → Kanpur, Varanasi, Bhopal (high readiness + urgency).
Phase 2 → Medium readiness but high engagement cities.
Phase 3 → Lower readiness markets (focus on awareness).
Ad Revenue Revival

FMCG → Client re-engagement, case studies, competitive packages.
Government → Local partnerships, transparent performance reporting.
Boosting Engagement

WhatsApp bulletins & alerts
Mobile-first e-papers with offline mode
Interactive polls, community forums, and video integration
Monetization Models

Print + Digital bundles (family plans)
Loyalty rewards with local businesses
Pay-per-article and micro-subscriptions
Regional Trust Building

Collaborations with local journalists and influencers
City-specific digital editions
Community events & town halls
📌 Ad-hoc Analysis Highlights
Top circulation drops: Varanasi (Jan 2021, Nov 2019), Jaipur (Jan 2020).
No ad category >50% revenue → diversification reduces risk.
Top print efficiency (2024): Ranchi, Ahmedabad, Patna, Jaipur, Varanasi (~90%).
Internet readiness growth (2021): Kanpur (+2.5%), Mumbai (+2.43%), Ranchi (–3.13%).
No city with continuous decline in both circulation + revenue (positive resilience).
